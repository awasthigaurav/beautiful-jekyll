subtitle: Hello, world!

My name is Gaurav Awasthi.  
I'm a first-year undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.  
I have no idea why I'm making this website, or what purpose it will serve, but oh, well.

### My story
I'm just your average college-going student, who, despite what his friends say, has a great sense of humour. As if there was ever any doubt.  

### My interests
