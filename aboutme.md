My name is Gaurav Awasthi.  
I'm a first-year undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.  
I have no idea why I'm making this website, or what purpose it will serve, but oh, well.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, but I will _probably_ update this later.
